# 20 LEDS using only 5 digital pins of ATMega328PB

*Managed to use only 5 pins to command 20 pins by multiplexing them 2 by 2

*Made a blinking function for each LED using the microcontroller registers

*Developed some nice patterns for the LED band using the functions mentioned before

*Used State Machines and Arrays of Function Pointers

*Connected an IR Obstacle Detection Module to a digital pin on which I enabled the external interrupt for state update
