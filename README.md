# 20 LEDS using only 5 digital pins of ATMega328PB

Managed to use only 5 pins to command 20 pins by multiplexing them 2 by 2
Made a blinking function for each LED using the microcontroller registers
Developed some nice patterns for the LED band using the functions mentioned before
Used State Machines and Arrays of Function Pointers
Connected an IR Obstacle Detection Module to a digital pin on which I enabled the external interrupt for state update
